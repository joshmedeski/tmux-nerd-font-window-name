## Requirements

The following dependencies are required in order to use this plugin:

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) (>=4)

## Installation (via tpm)

Add the following line to your tmux configuration file:

```sh
set -g @plugin 'joshmedeski/tmux-nerd-font-window-name'
```

Run `<prefix>+I` to trigger the tpm installer which will download
and source the plugin.

## Configuration

You can configure this plugin by creating a `~/.config/tmux/tmux-nerd-font-window-name.yml`
file. The following options can be changed:

```yml
config:
  fallback-icon: "?" # show when no definition is found
  multi-pane-icon: "î¯ˆ" # show when window has multiple panes (blank by default)
  show-name: true # show the window name with the icon (defaults to false)
  icon-position: "left" # show the icon to the "left" or "right" of the window name (defaults to left)

icons:
  zsh: "îž¢" # overwrite with your own symbol (Nerd Font icon, emoji, whatever!)
  cmatrix: "ðŸ¤¯" # add new entries that aren't included
```

### Custom Configuration File Path

By default, the plugin looks for the configuration file at:

```sh
~/.config/tmux/tmux-nerd-font-window-name.yml
```

You can override this path by adding the following line to your
tmux.conf file:

```sh
set -g @tmux-nerd-font-window-name-config-file "/your/custom/path.yml"
```
